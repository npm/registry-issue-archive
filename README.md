# :package: :ledger: the npm registry public tracker

This is a public issue tracker for the npm registry. It will be used
to announce major changes, forecast what we are working on, and to
field issues with the registry.

## What This Repo Is

If there are major releases going out, we will write them up here.

We will collect documentation about API endpoints here.

:white_check_mark: If you are having issues with the registry — a publish is
too slow, or if you can't install a package you know exists — **please open an
issue here**. If the topic is sensitive, please [contact
support](https://www.npmjs.com/support).

:white_check_mark: If you need something from the registry — a new API, or new information in an
existing API — **please open an issue here**. We will take the feature under
consideration: keep in mind, we often have to pass on really good ideas due to
time constraints. Wherever we can, we'll try to make your feature possible — if
not written by us, then at least providing the hooks so that you can write it
yourself.

:warning: This team does not enforce **policy**. If you are interested in the
policies of npm, please look at the [policies
repository](https://github.com/npm/policies).

:no_entry: This repository is **not** the place to bring package disputes.

:no_entry: This repository is **not** the place to debate the outcome of
package disputes. We rely on our support staff to administer the repository
according to the policies set forth in the [policies

npm policy, please open an issue there.

## What The Registry Team's Goals Are

1. :package: :truck: **The spice must flow.** The registry must continue to
   distribute packages to folks running `npm install`. In so far as is possible,
   ensure that disruptions are avoided, and where unavoidable or unexpected, they
   are at least brief. One outcome of this rule is that *making sure the service
   scales along with the ecosystem is always on our minds*.
2. :pill: :tea: **Ensure the health of the ecosystem**. This means making
   sure that bad actors are not able to adversely affect other users through
   their actions. (Put another way, it's our job to give all developers the
   elbow room they need to make sure they don't step on each others toes.)
3. :microscope: :rocket: **Develop features that help us keep running the registry**.
   This includes both free features and for-pay features — sometimes this will
   involve working with the Enterprise team to develop public registry features
   that add value to the enterprise product, sometimes this will involve building
   features for private modules users.
